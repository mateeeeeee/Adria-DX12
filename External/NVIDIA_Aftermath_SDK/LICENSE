LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR NVIDIA SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KITS

This license agreement, including exhibits attached ("Agreement") is a legal agreement
between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA software
development kit ("SDK").

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a description of the types
of items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and
assets (examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native API input/output
files), binary software, sample code, libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation.

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in
which the SDK is used.

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you
represent that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which
case "you" will mean the entity you represent.

If you don't have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you don't
accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use the
SDK.

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this Agreement, and
(b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the
relevant jurisdictions.

1.  License.

1.1 Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive,
non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in
this Agreement) to:

(i) Install and use the SDK, and

(ii) Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this Agreement as
distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a software application that
meets the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.

1.2 Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution grant:

(i) Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the included
portions of the SDK.

(ii) The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your application.

(iii) The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works of
sample source code distributed: "This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
Corporation."

(iv) Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as distributable, it is
delivered for your internal use only.

(v) The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating to the license
grant and license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA's intellectual property rights.
Additionally, you agree that you will protect the privacy, security and legal rights of
your application users.

(vi) You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution or use
of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce the
terms of your agreements with respect to distributed SDK.

1.3 Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies) to
access and use the SDK from your secure network to perform work on your behalf.

If you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by the
academic institution to access and use the SDK from your secure network.

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized
users. If you become aware that your authorized users didn't follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the non-compliance and prevent
new occurrences.

1.4 Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release, may not
be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different
security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to
commercial versions of NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result
in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.
You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release SDKs are
not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.  NVIDIA may choose not to
make available a commercial version of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to
abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release SDK at any time
without liability.

1.5 Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates to this
SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed
part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement.

You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA provides may change without
prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally maintains compatibility between versions,
NVIDIA may in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in future versions
of the SDK.

1.6 Third Party Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with, third party
software licensed by a NVIDIA supplier and/or open source software provided under an open
source license. Use of third-party software is subject to the third-party license terms,
or in the absence of third party terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to
third-party software is held by the copyright holders indicated in the third-party
software or license.

1.7 Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK not expressly granted to
you under this Agreement.

2.  Limitations.

The following license limitations apply to your use of the SDK:

2.1 You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright or other
proprietary notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.

2.2 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell, rent,
sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
SDK.

2.3 Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not indicate that
an application created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

2.4 You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security, digital rights
management or authentication mechanism in the SDK.

2.5 You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject to an open
source software license. As examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be (i) disclosed or distributed in source
code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii)
redistributable at no charge.

2.6 Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use the SDK
with any system or application where the use or failure of the system or application can
reasonably be expected to threaten or result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic
loss. Examples include use in nuclear, avionics, navigation, military, medical, life
support or other life critical applications. NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture
the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party,
in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses.

2.7 You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates, and their
respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any
and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines,
restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees and costs incident
to establishing the right of indemnification) arising out of or related to your use of the
SDK outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in compliance with its terms.

3.  Ownership.

3.1 NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK and its
modifications and derivative works, including their respective intellectual property
rights. This SDK may include software and materials from NVIDIA's licensors, and these
licensors are intended third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement with
respect to their intellectual property rights.

3.2 You may, but don't have to, provide to NVIDIA suggestions, feature requests or other
feedback regarding the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications to the SDK.
For any feedback that you voluntarily provide, you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates
a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify,
license, sublicense (through multiple tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through
multiple tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any royalties or fees to you.
NVIDIA will use feedback at its choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through the developer portal at
https://developer.nvidia.com.

4.  No Warranties.

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON
THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.

5.  Limitations of Liability.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS,
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK,
WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF
WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA'S AND ITS AFFILIATES TOTAL CUMULATIVE
LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE
LIABILITY OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS LIMIT.

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA or its
affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether
a remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and limitations of liability form
an essential basis of the bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these exclusions
or limitations of liability, the provisions of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the economic terms, would be substantially different.

6.  Termination.

6.1 This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or NVIDIA as
described below.

6.2 If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by stopping to use the SDK.

6.3 NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if: (i) you fail to comply with any
term of this Agreement and the non-compliance is not fixed within thirty (30) days
following notice from NVIDIA (or immediately if you violate NVIDIA's intellectual property
rights); (ii) you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA with
respect to the SDK; or (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in a country or,
in NVIDIA's sole discretion, the continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.

6.4 Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to promptly discontinue use of the
SDK and destroy all copies in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the termination of this Agreement. Upon
written request, you will certify in writing that you have complied with your commitments
under this section. Upon any termination of this Agreement all provisions survive except
for the licenses granted to you.

7.  General.

If you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and obligations, including by merger,
consolidation, dissolution or operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask for permission. Any
attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall be void and of no effect.
NVIDIA may assign, delegate or transfer this Agreement and its rights and obligations, and
if to a non-affiliate you will be notified.

You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably requested information to verify
your compliance with this Agreement.

This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States and of
the State of Delaware as those laws are applied to contracts entered into and performed
entirely within Delaware by Delaware residents, without regard to the conflicts of laws
principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
is specifically disclaimed. You agree to all terms of this Agreement in the English
language.

The state or federal courts residing in Santa Clara County, California shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding this, you agree that NVIDIA shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive
remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief in any jurisdiction.

If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be construed as limited to the
extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law and the
remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Unless otherwise specified,
remedies are cumulative.

Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other is an independent contractor in the
performance of this Agreement.

    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
    Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
